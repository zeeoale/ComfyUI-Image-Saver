# Save image with generation metadata in ComfyUI with support of GGUF checkpoints

Allows you to save images with their **generation metadata**. Includes the metadata compatible with *Civitai* geninfo auto-detection. Works with PNG, JPG and WEBP. For PNG stores both the full workflow in comfy format, plus a1111-style parameters. For JPEG/WEBP only the a1111-style parameters are stored. **Includes hashes of Models, LoRAs and embeddings for proper resource linking** on civitai.

You can find the example workflow file named `example-workflow.json`.

You can also add LoRAs to the prompt in \<lora:name:weight\> format, which would be translated into hashes and stored together with the metadata. For this it is recommended to use `ImpactWildcardEncode` from the fantastic [ComfyUI-Impact-Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Impact-Pack). It will allow you to convert the LoRAs directly to proper conditioning without having to worry about avoiding/concatenating lora strings, which have no effect in standard conditioning nodes. Here is an example:

This would have civitai autodetect all of the resources (assuming the model/lora/embedding hashes match):

## How to install?

### Method 1: Manager (Recommended)
If you have *ComfyUI-Manager*, you can simply search "**ComfyUI Image Saver**" and install these custom nodes.

### Method 2: Easy
If you don't have *ComfyUI-Manager*, then:
- Using CLI, go to the ComfyUI folder
- `cd custom_nodes`
- `git clone git@github.com:alexopus/ComfyUI-Image-Saver.git`
- `cd ComfyUI-Image-Saver`
- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
- Start/restart ComfyUI

## Customization of file/folder names

You can use following placeholders:

- `%date`
- `%time` *– format taken from `time_format`*
- `%model` *– full name of model file*
- `%basemodelname` *– name of model (without file extension)*
- `%seed`
- `%counter`
- `%sampler_name`
- `%scheduler`
- `%steps`
- `%cfg`
- `%denoise`

Example:

| `filename` value | Result file name |
| --- | --- |
| `%time-%basemodelname-%cfg-%steps-%sampler_name-%scheduler-%seed` | `2023-11-16-131331-Anything-v4.5-pruned-mergedVae-7.0-25-dpm_2-normal-1_01.png` |
